# 🌍 Unraveling the Challenges of Healthcare Accessibility in Africa

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores healthcare accessibility disparities across rural and urban regions in Africa. It focuses on the distribution of healthcare facilities, funding efficiency, emergency response times, workforce availability, and patient satisfaction. The goal is to uncover key challenges and provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze healthcare data and highlight gaps in accessibility between rural and urban regions, using data-driven insights to propose strategic improvements for equitable healthcare delivery.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Facility Distribution:** Rural areas have more healthcare facilities, while urban areas face funding inefficiencies.
- **Funding Efficiency:** Urban areas receive more funding per visit, but rural areas get more total funding.
- **Emergency Response Times:** Rural areas have slightly faster response times, but both regions need improvement.
- **Workforce:** Medical staff availability is similar across regions, though rural staff may have a heavier workload.
- **Patient Satisfaction:** Satisfaction rates are nearly identical across regions.

## 📊 Methodology

This project was conducted using a single structured dataset containing healthcare facility information across various regions. The goal was to assess disparities in healthcare access between rural and urban areas.

To perform this analysis, I first **categorized each region as either "Urban" or "Rural"** based on specific indicators using **Power BI's DAX formulas**. The classification criteria included:

- **Population greater than 5,000**  
- **Access to electricity**  
- **Access to internet services**  
- **Average distance to the nearest facility less than 10 km**

Regions meeting **all** the conditions above were labeled as **Urban**; otherwise, they were labeled as **Rural**.  
This classification enabled deeper comparative analysis of healthcare accessibility and funding between the two groups.

- **Tool Used:** Power BI
- **Methods:** 
  - Cleaned and transformed datasets in Power BI
  - Created interactive visuals including:
    - Clustered column charts
    - Scatter plots
    - Card visuals
    - Table and matrix visuals
  - Analyzed metrics like funding per visit, emergency response time, satisfaction rates, and staffing ratios

## ❓ Key Business Questions Answered

1. **How does healthcare facility distribution differ across regions?**  
   → Rural areas have significantly more facilities across all categories.

2. **Are urban facilities receiving more funding?**  
   → No. Total funding is much higher in rural regions, though urban areas receive slightly more funding per visit.

3. **Does higher funding lead to faster emergency response?**  
   → Not necessarily. Urban clinics, despite higher funding per visit, have the slowest response times.

4. **Which facilities are most efficient with funding per visit?**  
   → Funding efficiency is similar across facility types, with minor differences.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Increase Urban Funding:** Address underfunding in urban areas, especially where population density is high.
- **Optimize Rural Resources:** Reallocate staffing and infrastructure where rural facilities are overwhelmed.
- **Improve Emergency Services:** Focus efforts on reducing response times, particularly in urban clinics.
- **Adopt Digital Health Solutions:** Use telemedicine to improve access, especially in remote rural communities.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project reveals a complex landscape of healthcare access in Africa. While rural areas appear better served in terms of quantity, funding and infrastructure challenges persist. Urban areas, on the other hand, face inefficiencies due to underfunding and slower response times. With strategic investment and data-informed planning, equitable healthcare can be achieved across both regions.
