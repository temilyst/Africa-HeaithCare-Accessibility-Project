# 🌍 Unraveling the Challenges of Healthcare Accessibility in Africa

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates healthcare accessibility disparities between rural and urban regions in Africa. It examines the distribution of healthcare facilities, funding efficiency, emergency response times, workforce availability, and patient satisfaction. The goal is to identify key challenges in healthcare access and offer actionable insights for improving healthcare delivery.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this analysis is to assess the disparities in healthcare access across rural and urban regions of Africa and propose data-driven recommendations for improving accessibility and healthcare service delivery.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Facility Distribution:** Rural areas have more healthcare facilities, while urban areas face funding inefficiencies.
- **Funding Efficiency:** Urban areas receive more funding per visit, but rural areas get more total funding.
- **Emergency Response Times:** Rural areas have slightly faster response times, but both regions need improvement.
- **Workforce:** Medical staff availability is similar across regions, though rural staff may have a heavier workload.
- **Patient Satisfaction:** Satisfaction rates are nearly identical across regions.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – for data modeling and creating interactive visualizations (clustered column charts, scatter plots, tables, and stacked columns).
- **Excel** – for data manipulation and initial analysis.

## 📊 Methodology

The dataset contains structured information about healthcare facilities across various African regions. The regions were grouped into **Urban** and **Rural** categories using **Power BI**'s DAX formula based on the following criteria:

- **Population** > 5,000
- **Access to electricity** 
- **Access to the internet**
- **Average distance to the nearest healthcare facility** < 10 km

Regions meeting **all** the criteria were classified as **Urban**, while the rest were classified as **Rural**. No major data cleaning was needed, as the dataset was already well-organized for this classification.

## ❓ Key Business Questions Answered

1. **How does healthcare facility distribution compare between rural and urban regions?**  
   Rural areas have significantly more healthcare facilities overall.

2. **Are urban healthcare facilities receiving more funding?**  
   No, rural healthcare facilities receive more total funding, despite urban areas receiving slightly more funding per visit.

3. **Does higher funding correlate with faster emergency response times?**  
   There is no clear correlation; urban clinics have higher funding but longer response times.

4. **Which facility type is most efficient in terms of funding per visit?**  
   Funding efficiency is relatively consistent across facility types, with minor variations.

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Increase Funding to Urban Areas:** Urban healthcare facilities should receive more funding to meet the demand in densely populated areas.
- **Optimize Resource Allocation in Rural Areas:** Strengthen staffing and infrastructure in rural facilities to better handle the larger patient load.
- **Improve Emergency Response Times:** Both urban and rural regions need to optimize their emergency services, with particular attention to urban clinics.
- **Adopt Digital Health Solutions:** Leverage telemedicine and digital tools to improve healthcare access, particularly in rural areas.
